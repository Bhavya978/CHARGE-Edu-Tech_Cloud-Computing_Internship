The diagram shows that the cloud platform hosts the MongoDB database and the backend API built with Node.js.
The frontend, built using HTML, CSS, and AngularJS, interacts with the backend API to retrieve data from the database and display it to the user.
The payment gateway is integrated with the frontend to allow users to make payments for their orders.
